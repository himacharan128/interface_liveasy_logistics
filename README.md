Welcome to the Liveasy Logistics Mobile Application Interface repository! This repository contains the Flutter code for developing the user interface of the Liveasy Logistics mobile application. The app aims to connect truckers and shippers, providing them with a seamless platform for efficient logistics operations and improved system transparency.

## Features

3. OTP Authentication: The third screen facilitates OTP (One-Time Password) authentication, leveraging Firebase authentication services. This adds an extra layer of security and simplifies the login process for users.

4. User Type Selection: Once the user is successfully authenticated, they are directed to the app interface. Here, they are prompted to select whether they are a shipper or a transporter, enabling them to access the relevant functionalities and services.

5. End-to-End Load Visibility: The app provides comprehensive information about the load, offering end-to-end visibility to users. This feature allows shippers and truckers to track their cargo, ensuring transparency and efficiency throughout the logistics process.

6. Trip History: Users can access their trip history, allowing them to review past shipments, monitor performance, and make informed decisions based on their logistics data.
