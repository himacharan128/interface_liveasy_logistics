# Phone Authentication Using Firebase
Liveasy Logistics Mobile Application Interface 

Welcome to the Liveasy Logistics Mobile Application Interface repository! This repository contains the Flutter code for developing the user interface of the Liveasy Logistics mobile application. The app aims to connect truckers and shippers, providing them with a seamless platform for efficient logistics operations and improved system transparency.

## Features

The Liveasy Logistics mobile application offers the following key features:

1. Language Selection: The first screen prompts the user to select their preferred language, ensuring a personalized experience for users from diverse backgrounds.

2. Mobile Number Verification: On the second screen, users are required to enter their mobile number for verification purposes. This step helps ensure the security and authenticity of the user's account.

3. OTP Authentication: The third screen facilitates OTP (One-Time Password) authentication, leveraging Firebase authentication services. This adds an extra layer of security and simplifies the login process for users.

4. User Type Selection: Once the user is successfully authenticated, they are directed to the app interface. Here, they are prompted to select whether they are a shipper or a transporter, enabling them to access the relevant functionalities and services.

5. End-to-End Load Visibility: The app provides comprehensive information about the load, offering end-to-end visibility to users. This feature allows shippers and truckers to track their cargo, ensuring transparency and efficiency throughout the logistics process.

6. Trip History: Users can access their trip history, allowing them to review past shipments, monitor performance, and make informed decisions based on their logistics data.

7. Nearby Petrol Pumps and Police Stations: The app provides valuable information about nearby petrol pumps and police stations. This feature helps users plan their routes, ensuring they have access to essential services during their journeys.

## Technologies Used

The Liveasy Logistics Mobile Application Interface is developed using the Flutter framework, which enables the creation of beautiful and highly performant native applications for iOS and Android platforms. The app leverages Firebase's authentication service for seamless and secure OTP authentication.

## MY CONTRIBUTIONS
During my work on Liveasy Logistics, I developed the interface for the Android mobile application. Liveasy Logistics is an online platform that connects truckers and shippers, aiming to streamline operations and promote transparency in the logistics industry. The mobile application, built using Flutter, offers a user-friendly experience with four key screens.

The first screen allows users to select their preferred language, ensuring accessibility for a diverse user base. On the second screen, users are prompted to enter their mobile number, enabling seamless communication and verification within the app. The third screen implements OTP authentication, leveraging the power of Firebase for secure and reliable verification.

Once successfully authenticated, users are welcomed into the app's interface, where they are prompted to specify their role as either a shipper or a transporter. This selection grants them access to a range of features designed to enhance their logistics experience. Users can benefit from end-to-end load visibility, enabling them to track their shipments throughout the entire process. Additionally, they can access their trip history to review past activities and gain valuable insights.

Liveasy Logistics goes the extra mile by providing information on nearby petrol pumps and police stations, ensuring that users have essential resources at their fingertips. This feature enhances safety and convenience for both truckers and shippers, contributing to a more efficient and reliable logistics ecosystem.

By leveraging the power of Flutter and Firebase, I successfully developed an intuitive and secure interface for the Liveasy Logistics mobile application. Join Liveasy Logistics today and experience the future of logistics management, where connectivity, transparency, and efficiency converge.
